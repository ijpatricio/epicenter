# Epicenter

This is an Application Starter Kit. It is an Internal Tool for an Organization (Intranet).
The goal is to have a foundation to build custom requirements, in a swift way.
The used stack is composed by Laravel (Sanctum - stateful api - easy), Vue, Nuxt, Vuetify, Docker.

The foundation for the design is a "blessed" version from Jo√£o Teixeira. Check [Template Link](https://store.vuetifyjs.com/products/lux-admin-pro)
